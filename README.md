# debian-ksmtuned
Debian packaging of ksmtuned (taken from the qemu-kvm RedHat package sources).
A wishlist bug to integrate ksmtuned and ksmctl into the qemu-kvm package in Debian was opened:

   «KSM: include ksmtuned/ksmctl». https://bugs.debian.org/776681

but for now feel free to use this package, especially if you need ksmtuned in Jessie or older
Debian releases.
